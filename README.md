# This Repository
This repository, Python Calculators is where I develop different python calculators, such as download speed
calculators or battery calculators. I also make measuring scripts for different purposes, such as bateries. Not 
only do I work on code and fix issues here, but I also publish Updates and Bux Fixes. I also want to add that 
all of the code in this repository can be ran without any Python Packages, and it can work with the original 
Python 3 console. This source code is available to everyone, and can be modified. Every code you would want 
to add will be approven by me, and could be added to the project, so feel free to contribute !

# How to use ?
These scripts are made using Python 3. To run them, you can use the official Python 3, available at
"https://www.python.org/downloads". You can also use any third-party IDE. As I mentioned in the 
description, this code can be ran directly using the Python 3 console, without using any libraries.
You can use any Python that is 3.x.x.

# Disclaimer
This project doesn't have any affiliation with Python OR any other brands mentioned. I also want
to add that this code is fully open source, which means that it can be installed and modified by
anyone, but has to be approved by me. If you find any problems or bugs, feel free to report them 
on my Git page. Some of the images used in this projects could be taken from certain web pages,
