# This Repository ➕➖
This repository, Python Calculators is where I develop different python calculators, such as download speed
calculators or battery calculators. I also make measuring scripts for different purposes, such as batteries. All od the different purpose calculators will be presented in the files and the changelog. Not only do I work on code and fix issues here, but I also publish Updates and Bug Fixes. I also want to add that 
all of the code in this repository can be ran without any Python Packages, and it can work with the original 
Python 3 console. This source code is available to everyone, and can be modified.

# How to use ? 🐍
These scripts are made using Python 3. To run them, you can use the official Python 3, available at
"https://www.python.org/downloads", or using the command below if you use bash:

-First, update Superuser (sudo):
<pre> sudo apt update</pre>
-Now, install python if you don't have it:
<pre> sudo apt install python3</pre>
As I mentioned in the description, this code can be run directly using the Python 3 console, without using any
libraries. You can also use any third-party IDE, but it has to be Python 3 or newer (3.x.x)

# Contributing 👍
Contributing to this project would be a great help. There are many ways you could help me, such as reporting bugs, so I can fix them. You can also spread this library, so more people can contribute. You can send me ideas for fixes or even new code, which I will verify and then post, so feel free to contribute, it would really help me !


# Disclaimer ⚠️
This project doesn't have any affiliation with Python OR any other brands mentioned. I also want
to add that this code is fully open source, which means that it can be installed and modified by
anyone, but has to be approved by me. If you find any problems or bugs, feel free to report them 
on my Git page. Some of the images used in this projects could be taken from certain web pages,
